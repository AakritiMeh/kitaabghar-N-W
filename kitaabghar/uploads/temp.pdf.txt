7 Given two numbers a and b we usually say that a is less than
or equal to b denoted by ab if the value of a is smaller than
or equal to b Here we define a new relation abin a different
way as follows a is said to be less than or equal to b denoted
byab if the last digit of a is less than or equal to the last
digit of b For example 27 is less than 19 since 7 is less than 9
29 and 39 are said to be equal 38 is greater than 102 Given n

a decreasing order as per the order defined above For example

posed by you Compute the timecomplexity of your algorithm
Now modify the algorithm by following a different logic for the
same problem so that the modified algorithm is more efficient
than the original algorithm List out the modifications done in
the original algorithm that has improved the efficiency of the
algorithm

forAi to be inserted Instead of a linearsearch method modify
the algorithm A by using the binarysearch method instead
of the linearsearch method to find the appropriate place for
Ai to be inserted Let the modified algorithm be called as A

same problem so that the modified algorithm is more efficient
than the original algorithm List out the modifications done in
the original algorithm that has improved the efficiency of the
algorithm
9 In the insertionsort algorithm A discussed in the class in lines
57 we apply a linearsearch method to find the appropriate place
forAi to be inserted Instead of a linearsearch method modify
the algorithm A by using the binarysearch method instead
of the linearsearch method to find the appropriate place for
Ai to be inserted Let the modified algorithm be called as A
Analyse both the algorithms AandAand conclude which is4
more efficient In case you are not aware of the binarysearch
method please learn yourself from CLRS book
